  title: Pitch Perfect
  author: UltraCboy
  description: "There, my first non-needy module. This one requires you to identify
    the names of pitches played by the module. However, since perfect pitch is something
    very few people have, there are plenty of features to help those who would struggle
    with this.\n\nIf you have any issues or suggestions, your best bet is to contact
    me on Discord, either through DMs or through the KTANE Discord server. My username
    is UltraCboy#4639.\r\n\r\nModule idea by ktane1, implemented by UltraCboy\nModule
    ID: pitchPerfect\nManual Page: Available in the build folder, will eventually
    be available at ktane.timwi.de\r\n\r\nThank you, apologies to the tone deaf, and
    happy defusing!"
